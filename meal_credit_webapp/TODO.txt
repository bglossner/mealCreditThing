- Mb abstract event variable in onChange function of input so there is not event but rather just value given to function
- Implement fetch instead of XHR OR mb axios?
    - I have seen conflicting views on which one is best
    - XHR has most abilities but is hardest to use
    - Fetch is gaining popularity but the catch doesn't fire on error responses unless server can't be contacted. Supposed to be the future tho
    - Axios is an outside library, so mb not the best. Seems like it has decent support and is better than fetch for use
