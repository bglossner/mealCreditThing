EASIER TO CHANGE
    -- Change time so it makes sure the user cant enter bullshit data
    -- Make it so that when EditAvPost screen times are clicked, it reflects not the current time, but the one on the post instead
            Right now, it uses the calendar rather than the actual given datetimes
    
UNKNOWN DIFFICULTY BUT IMPORTANT
    -- Check user connectedness to internet when trying to connect to server

SCREENS
    -- Settings (closer to being done now)

NOT MVP (Do later)
    -- Chat stuff
    -- Maps
    -- See Availability Posts
